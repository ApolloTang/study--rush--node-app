The project field is not working when using with rig?

This monorepo is derived from [02b-node-apps-w-rig--typescript-json-project](https://github.com/ApolloTang/study--rush--node-app/tree/main/02b-node-apps-w-rig--typescript-json-project).

In this experiment, as suggested, I attempted setting the flag:
   
`"buildProjectReferences": true,`

But typescript still not running.
